NOTE: I Used this in a Proxmox LXC for jellyfin when my DB was locked and once when it was malformed. This wont fix all issues but it worked for me a few times

CD into your dabase folder Default is /var/lib/jellyfin/data

Step 1)Extract db

> sqlite3 jellyfin.db ".dump" > data.sql

Step2) Rename old db

>mv jellyfin.db jellyfin2.db

Alternitivly you can use WinCP to tunnel into your host server and rename it that way

Step 3)Rebuild DB

> sqlite3 jellyfin.db < data.sql
